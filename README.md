# Computer-programming-data-processing
Nowadays, Python has been increasingly become one of the top programming languages that can be used in a variety of fields. Especially in medical data analysis, it is the most popular language. Via Python, many tasks from data analysis and machine learning, deep learning have been resolved efficiently. This repository will introduce Python programming language focusing mostly on data analysis and machine learning, especially how to apply it into medical data.
This repository will continue to introduce Python programming language applying into data processing and machine learning. We can learn how to perform data analysis and implement different types of machine learning and deep learning classifiers.
